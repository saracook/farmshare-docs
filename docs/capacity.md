## Adding Capacity

FarmShare does not have a dedicated funding source available to it, and we appreciate any contributions that people can make.  For example:

* If you are using FarmShare for a class, let your department chair know that you are using it.
* If you are a registered student group using FarmShare, let your faculty representative and/or ASSU know that you are using it.
* If you have spare funds available, [email us](mailto:srcc-support@stanford.edu?subject=FarmShare funds contribution) and we can arrange either a iJournals transfer to our PTA, or a capital purchase from your PTA.
* If you already have hardware being supported by SRCC, we may be able to use that hardware once you are done with it.

We appreciate anything you can do to get the word out about FarmShare and how awesome it is!
