# FarmShare HPC Cluster

FarmShare is Stanford's community computing environment. It is intended for use in coursework and unsponsored research; it is not approved for use with high-risk data, or for use in sponsored research.

FarmShare evolved from the old, public UNIX cluster, once located on the second floor of Sweet Hall, which was itself a successor to systems like the University's original timeshare service, LOTS. FarmShare came online in Autumn Quarter 2016.

The FarmShare resources are focused on making it easier to learn how to parallelize research computing tasks and use research software including a “scheduler” or “distributed resource management system” to submit compute jobs. By using FarmShare, new researchers can more easily adapt to using larger clusters when they have big projects that involve using federally funded resources, shared Stanford clusters, or on a small grant funded cluster. Full SUNet (or sponsorship) required.

# Cluster Components

FarmShare consists of three classes of servers:

* The *rice* servers ...
