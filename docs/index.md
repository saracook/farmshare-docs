# Welcome to FarmShare!

FarmShare is Stanford's community computing environment. It is intended for use in coursework and unsponsored research; it is not approved for use with high-risk data, or for use in sponsored research.

FarmShare evolved from the old, public UNIX cluster, once located on the second floor of Sweet Hall, which was itself a successor to systems like the University's original timeshare service, LOTS. FarmShare came online in Autumn Quarter 2016.

The FarmShare resources are focused on making it easier to learn how to parallelize research computing tasks and use research software including a “scheduler” or “distributed resource management system” to submit compute jobs. By using FarmShare, new researchers can more easily adapt to using larger clusters when they have big projects that involve using federally funded resources, shared Stanford clusters, or on a small grant funded cluster. Full SUNet (or sponsorship) required.

## Cluster Components

FarmShare consists of three classes of servers:

* The *rice* servers ...
* The *wheat* servers ...
* The *oat* servers ...

All FarmShare servers run [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NobleNumbat/ReleaseNotes)

FarmShare currently has 26 compute nodes along with 4 login nodes.

## Eligibility

FarmShare is available to anyone who has a full-service SUNetID. A full-service SUNetID is one that has email service; if you can successfully get to [Stanford Webmail](https://webmail.stanford.edu/), then you are eligible to use FarmShare 2 for academic work and small research jobs! If you do not already have a full-service SUNetID (maybe because you are a visiting researcher), you can get a sponsored full-service SUNetID. Read more about [SUNetID levels](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/accounts/sunetids).

Note that, in order to get a sponsored SUNetID, a monthly fee will be charged by University IT. Only people with spending authority may sponsor a SUNetID. Sponsorships can be obtained and paid for through [Sponsorship Manager](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/sponsorship/).  Current rates are available from the Sponsored Account [Rates page](https://uit.stanford.edu/rates/sponsorship).

FarmShare is meant for [low- or moderate-risk data](https://uit.stanford.edu/guide/riskclassifications), and is primarily intended for class work and for other general- and personal-use work (research and training). It is not meant for sponsored research (where you have a dedicated source of funding), and is not approved for handling high-risk data.

## Sponsored and Departmental Research

If you are doing sponsored or departmental research, then FarmShare might not be the right place for you. Instead, if the data you are working with is all low-risk, then you should consider getting access to our Sherlock Cluster! The [Sherlock web site](https://www.sherlock.stanford.edu/docs/getting-started/#how-to-request-an-account) has more information about how to get access.

## Getting Help

Most FarmShare support is provided during business hours, either via email or during academic-year office hours.

For email support, send a message to [srcc-support](mailto:srcc-support@stanford.edu?subject=FarmShare 2 support). Make sure you have "FarmShare 2" somewhere in the subject line, and please be as detailed as possible with your request!
